# ufracSims
*treemaker*: Generates rooted binary branching trees with each internal branch of length 1, and tips labeled 1:S.

*unifrac*: Samples from 1:S species, creates an OTU table and calculates the unweighted unifrac distance.

*find_alpha*: Removes observations that are less probable than **alpha** based on a beta-binomial conjugate prior model.

*unifrac_simulation*: replicates **n_reps** samples and calculates unifrac.

*sim_results*: several simulations of interest.
